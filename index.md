## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 6, part 2

   This was pretty frustrating yet, fun/interesting labs we've done. I was always curious on how implementing game ideas would work. I was really confused with using STOI and STOD as it was my first time implementing it into the labs. The functions of calculating if Aces should be 11 or 1 was really cool. It was also funny when I used 10 if statements as a brute force way, of completing the valuation.


* Lab 3, part 1

   This lab was just enjoyable because of the partner Alejandro Leon, I got to work with, was really kind and helpful. The functions on how they calculated your BMR was also amazing. It really demonstrated that I could use my coding knowledge on dementing mathematical equations, and possibly future projects of my own that require taxing equations or repetitive tasks.

* Lab 7, part 1

   This lab although having only one part was extreamly fun and diffucult. The amount of if statements we used was absurd. But it also taught me the legnths of usefulness if statements can be if used propperly. I definetly enjoyed learning if statements and it's limitations with "OR" ,"AND", "!" , and "==" statements/Parameters.
